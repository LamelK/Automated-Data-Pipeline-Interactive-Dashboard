# Automated Data-Pipeline With Interactive-Dashboard 

## Overview  
This project automates the process of collecting, processing, and visualizing data using AWS cloud services.The pipeline efficiently ingests raw data, performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, and creates interactive dashboards for data-driven insights 

The goal is to demonstrate hands-on cloud engineering and data analytics skills by designing and implementing a complete data solution from automating ETL workflows to building interactive, insightful dashboards for analysis and reporting.

## Architecture  

This architecture addresses a common business challenge: automating the end-to-end process of ingesting raw data, transforming it, and making it available for business intelligence and reporting. Specifically, it outlines a serverless and highly scalable solution on AWS to process data, store it in a relational database, and then power a BI application for user visualization.

### Key Components  
| AWS Service       | Purpose                                  |  
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| EventBridge       | Weekly cron trigger                      |  
| Step Functions    | Orchestrates data workflow               |  
| Lambda            | Extract,Transform,Load |  
| S3 + VPC Endpoint | Secure intermediate storage              |  
| RDS (MySQL)       | Structured data storage                  |  
| EC2 (Metabase)    | Dashboard hosting                        |

## Data Flow  
![Process Steps](sequence_diagram.png)

- **Trigger**: Weekly EventBridge cron  
- **Extract**: Mockaroo API   
- **Transform**: Step Functions workflow ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí S3
- **Load**:S3 ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí RDS   
- **Visualize**: RDS ‚Üí Metabase dashboards  


By integrating serverless architecture and secure VPC networking, this design delivers a scalable, cost-effective, and maintainable data pipeline. The final result is an automatically updated, interactive dashboard providing fresh data insights every Monday without manual intervention.
